          <h3> Inclusion as a Starting Point: <i>Refiguring The Future</i> </h3>
          
          <p>REFRESH breaks down systemic cultural and economic oppression and offers validation, visibility, and new 
            approaches to sustainable artistic practice. <i>Refiguring the Futrue</i>, our inaugural exhibition, will 
            demonstrate a politically engaged and inclusive 
            vision of what art, science and technology means, bringing special attention to populations that have been 
            historically marginalized including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ and disabled artists from around the 
            globe. REFRESH, in collaboration with Eyebeam
           will include community-based and site-specific projects, a gallery exhibition, and a 
            host of public programming, bringing together a constellation of venues and 
            organizations across New York City in <i>Refiguring The Furture</i> which opens in early 2019. 
          </p>
          
          <h3> A History of Invisibility </h3>

<p>“Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?” The Guerilla Girls asked this question in 1989 but the answer has 
  changed little in the intervening years. A painstaking review of the statistics in 2016 confirmed that more than 90% of 
  winners of a major festival in the arts self-identified as male, and two out of the 100 top selling artists at auction are 
  women. The difference in price between the most expensive female and male artists is also vast; $44.4 million vs. $179 
  million. Women have been largely excluded from history, criticism, and curation of major art historical movements, even 
  when they participate in great numbers as in the case of Abstract Expressionism. </p>
  
<p>The field of art, science and technology hybridize art world politics with those of tech and science culture. 
  A comparatively new field, it has inherited and tended to perpetuate the oppressive structures of both domains. 
  Diverse voices are vital to the field but have often been excluded from large artist residencies and projects.
  Despite this history, we believe art has a tremendous potential in the current cultural climate to open new trajectories 
  and ethical choices by envisioning different possible futures.</p>

          <h3> A Platform for Change </h3>

        <p> Art, science, and technology are key social forces but we have yet to see a major retrospective or exhibition in 
          United States grappling with the politics of this cultural interplay. Taking an explicitly political and 
          socially-engaged focus on this intersection, <i>Refiguring the Future</i> is the first dedicated exhibition of its kind.</p>
          <p>
            As the global present becomes increasingly politicized and polemicized it is more important than ever to challenge our 
            ideas of what’s next: to push and probe, tear apart, and re-envision what the future can and should be from the ground up. 
            By showcasing feminist, queer, de-colonial, disabled and historically marginalized artists <i>Refiguring the Future</i>
            will offer visions of the future 
            outside and beyond the dominant discourse, where we can find new possibilities of real change.
          </p>
